Airline Ticket Reservation System
Overview
This project is a Python-based Airline Ticket Reservation System designed to simulate a simplified booking process. It demonstrates key programming concepts such as:

Arrays (1D & 2D) for seat layout
Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)
String manipulation for searching and validation
File handling for data persistence
Optional recursion for seat availability checks


Features

Book Ticket

Enter passenger details and assign an available seat.


View Seats

Display a 2D seating arrangement (e.g., 5 rows × 6 columns).


Cancel Booking

Remove a passenger’s booking and update seat availability.


Search Passenger

Find passenger details by name.


Save & Load Data

Booking details are stored in bookings.txt for persistence.




System Requirements

Python 3.x
Text-based interface (Tkinter GUI optional for bonus)


How to Run

Ensure Python 3 is installed.
Place airline_reservation.py and bookings.txt in the same directory.
Run the program:
Shellpython airline_reservation.pyShow more lines

Follow the menu options to book, view, cancel, or search bookings.
